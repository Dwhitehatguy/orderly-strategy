# example-orderly-submission

An Example submission for the Orderly-Google Hackathon.  This contains a [Jupyter Notebook](https://ipython.org/notebook.html) with a basic strategy that has been backtested on a dataset.  This can be made much more extensive by backtesting on a variety of assets, tuning the strategy to perform reactively to data as it is ingested, among many other factors.

Additionally, there should be a small README provided with an overview of the strategy.  See the hackathon submission guidelines for more information.
