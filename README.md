#### 2. **Market Focus**
The strategy is designed for use in **cryptocurrency markets**, specifically targeting the **DOGE/USD pair**. The inclusion of sentiment analysis makes it highly adaptable to other markets that are influenced by news and media, though itâ€™s optimized for volatile assets like Dogecoin.

#### 3. **Time Horizon**
This is a **short-term trading strategy** intended to run for a maximum of **14 days**, with trades executed based on **five-minute intervals**. It is suitable for day traders and short-term swing traders who aim to capitalize on rapid price changes and market sentiment shifts.

#### 4. **Indicators**
The strategy employs two key components:
- **Technical Indicator:**
  - **SMA Crossover**: Uses a 10-period SMA and a 30-period SMA to detect trend reversals. A crossover of the 10-period SMA above the 30-period SMA generates a buy signal (bullish trend), while the opposite crossover generates a sell signal (bearish trend).
  
- **Sentiment Indicator:**
  - **Sentiment Analysis**: Fetches recent news headlines related to the asset and estimates market sentiment (positive or negative). When sentiment is **highly positive** (probability > 0.999), it signals strong bullish momentum; when **highly negative**, it signals bearish momentum.

#### 5. **Execution**
The strategy operates as follows:
- **Buy Signal**: If the 10-period SMA crosses above the 30-period SMA (bullish crossover) or sentiment analysis indicates an extremely positive sentiment with high confidence (probability > 0.999), the strategy initiates a long position.
- **Sell Signal**: If the 30-period SMA crosses above the 10-period SMA (bearish crossover) or sentiment analysis indicates highly negative sentiment, the strategy initiates a sell or short position.
- **Position Management**: Any open position is closed before executing a new trade to avoid overlapping positions, and the strategy trades with an order size of **99.9%** of the available capital.

#### 6. **Why It Works**
The **Extended SMA Cross Strategy** enhances traditional technical analysis by incorporating real-time sentiment analysis. Here's why this approach can be effective:
- **Market Sentiment Influence**: Cryptocurrency markets are highly reactive to news, and sentiment analysis allows the strategy to capitalize on this. By filtering news headlines and quantifying sentiment, it ensures that trades are aligned with broader market sentiment.
- **Dual Confirmation**: By combining **technical signals** (SMA crossover) with **sentiment-based signals**, the strategy seeks to avoid false positives from either indicator, increasing the likelihood of entering trades in the direction of stronger trends.
- **Volatility Capture**: The integration of fast-moving market sentiment with short-term price movements positions this strategy to perform well in volatile markets like Dogecoin, where both technical trends and news events drive price action.

This strategy is ideal for traders looking to enhance their technical setups with a sentiment-driven approach, adding robustness to trading decisions in fast-paced markets.
